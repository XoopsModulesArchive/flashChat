XOOPS INTEGRATION FOR FLASHCHAT
*******************p************

This file describes the steps required to integrate FlashChat into a Xoops environment. The normal installation procedure, as described in the FlashChat readme.txt file, does NOT apply in this case.

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS PRECISELY!

STEP 1:
Create a subfolder in the modules directory of Xoops, called "flashChat". Please note that the folder name MUST be "flashChat" (i.e., it's case-sensitive).

STEP 2:
Delete the "index.php" file, and then rename the "index_xoops.php" file to "index.php".

STEP 3:
Open the "common.php" file located in the "inc" directory of your FlashChat distribution. You should be able to use any plain-text editor, like TextPad (www.textpad.com) or Windows Notepad. Find the group of PHP commands that relate to CMS integration. They will have the "cmses/" label in them:

//include_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/defaultCMS.php');
//include_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/statelessCMS.php');
//include_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/phpNukeCMS.php');
//include_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/postNukeCMS.php');
//include_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/xoopsCMS.php' );
... etc...

As shown above, you must put double-slashes before ALL CMSES except for the "xoopsCMS" line. This will deactivate all other CMS support except for Xoops. Double-slashes are how programmers "comment-out" a line, thus deactivating it.

Thus, ONLY this line will NOT be commented:

include_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/xoopsCMS.php');

STEP 4:
Upload all files in the FlashChat folder to your "modules" directory in Xoops. Please make sure that you have the "sql" and "templates" subdirectories copied, too!

STEP 5:
Login as the Xoops administrator and go to module administration page - you will see FlashChat module in the list. Install it and go to homepage of the site to see it. Now, FlashChat must run from this menu.


If you notice any errors in these steps, or have any suggestions for improvement, please post a message on the TUFaT.com support forum, located at http://www.tufat.com

Thank you for using FlashChat!
